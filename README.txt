Task Details :


I have tried to complete the task with full honesty and have tried my best to keep the code original.

For the main login page design I have used the following:
1. Bootstrap
2. Font Awesome
3. Bootstrap Social
4. CSS3 (For the gradient background)

Description:

The Background has been created using css gradient method.
The main div that holds all the form inputs is designed using table. The table helped me to organize the different fields
properly.

The Social buttons which let the user sign in through other social accounts were designed and included in the page using Bootstrap 
Social.
Finally to check whether the Screen which opens the website is wide enough, simple jQuery function is used to check the screen width.
If the screen is small (md or sm) then a different Login page is loaded- index_mobile.html.
Special emphasis is also payed on the indentation of the code for better readability.
I hope I have done justice to the task and expect a reply soon.
Thankyou!!
